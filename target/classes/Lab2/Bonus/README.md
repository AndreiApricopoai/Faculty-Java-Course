# LAB2

An instance of the "Best Route Problem" consists of locations and roads. Locations may be cities, airports, gas stations, etc.
Two locations may be connected by a road, or not. Roads may be highways, express, country, etc.

Each location has a name, type and x, y coordinates (assume that the locations are placed in a cartesian coordinate system).
Each road has a type, length and a speed limit. The length of a road should not be less than the euclidian distance between the location coordinates.
We consider the problem of determining the "best" route from one location to another.

# Bonus:

- Create a class to describe the solution.
- Implement an algorithm to find the best route from a location to another, either as the shortest route, or the fastest route.
- Generate large random instances of the problem and analyze the performance of your algorithm (running times, memory consumption).
