### Homework (2p)
* Create all entity classes and repositories. Implement properly the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
* Create a generic AbstractRepository using generics in order to simplify the creation of the repository classes. You may take a look at the CrudRepository interface from Spring Framework.
* Insert, using JPA, a large number of fake artists and albums in the database and log the execution time of your JPQL statements.
